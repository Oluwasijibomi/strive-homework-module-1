EXERCISE 1
Write the code to execute a SUM between the number 12 and 20

/* EXERCISE 5
Create two variables: name1 and name 2. name1 is equal to john, name2 is equal to John.
Verify that name1 is different from name2. 
Verify then, that name1 and name2 are equals if both lowercase (without changing the value of name2)
